# Comparative Genomics of Helicobacter species from different avian hosts

## Background
_Helicobacter_ species are Gram-negative bacteria known for their colonization of the gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary tracts in various hosts, including humans, non-human mammals and avian species. Among these, _H. pylori_ stands out due to its prevalence in human populations and its association with significant gastrointestinal pathologies, such as gastritis, peptic ulcers, mucosa associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma and even gastric cancer. In avian populations, another prominent species, _H. pullorum_, has been identified as a causative agent of vibrionic hepatitis and other important pathologies in fowls. However, beyond these well-studied species, the genus Helicobacter encompasses a diverse array of organisms, many of which colonize avian hosts. Despite the severity of its impact, research on _H. pullorum_ and the other species that colonizes avian hosts remain relatively limited compared to its human counterpart. Of particular concern is the potential for zoonotic transfer between avian hosts and humans, as well as the occurrence of horizontal gene transfer events within and between different _Helicobacter_ species. These dynamics not only raise questions about the evolution and adaptation of these bacteria but also pose challenges for public health and disease management.
